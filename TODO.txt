SystemParametersInfoA allocates memory when getting the work-area.
We need to free this somehow.

Pixelmasking should take an area to draw in.
Masking needs an AA layer.

After 30 sec of runtime NtTraceEvent is called which heapallocs.
We need to stop this or free it..


New renderingsystem idea:
1. Everything is a quad, fuck lines.
2. Move scanline by scanline and check if clipx < area x.
3. Bitblt the scanline.
